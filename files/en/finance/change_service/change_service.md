Change service in the charged period
====================================

Sometimes you need to change service, but old service is already charged and the system does not allow you to do this for a current month, only for the next month.

For solving this issue you have to go through the next steps:

1. Cancel last charge using the button on the customer's billing tab:

2. Now you can change the desired service. So, go to the 'Services' tab and change it using "Change plan" button.

3. Last step, you have to charge customer again. In this case, please, use "To charge & Invoice" button on the same billing tab:

**Attention!** All the steps above are for recurring billing customers only.
