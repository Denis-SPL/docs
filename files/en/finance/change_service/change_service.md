Change service in the charged period
====================================

Sometimes you need to change services for customers, but old services are already charged for and therefore the system does not allow you to do this for the current month but only for the next month.

To resolve this issue you have to go through the next steps:

1. Cancel the last charge using the button on the customer's billing tab in `Customers / View / Billing overview`:

2. Now the option to change the desired service will be available/possible. So, navigate to the 'Services' tab and change the service using the "Change plan" button.

3. The last step, you have to charge customer again using the "charge & Invoice" button in the Billing tab:

**Attention!** All the steps above are for recurring billing customers only.
