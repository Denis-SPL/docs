Configuring Tariff Plans
========================

Splynx has 3 different types of tariff plans - _Internet_, _Voice_ and _Custom_. Plans are used to assign a service to customer and charge him.

_Internet plans_ are also limiting the speed accordingly to plan settings. _Voice Plans_ are used to create fees for voice services and for CDR processing. With _Custom plans_ you are able to charge customers for IPTV services, public IP addresses and other similar services.
