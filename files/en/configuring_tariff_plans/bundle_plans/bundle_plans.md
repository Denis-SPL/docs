Bundle Plans
============

Bundle Plan is a new kind of plan from version 2.1 that allows to group internet, voice and custom services in only one, so with that is possible to set a one common price for the services group. It also improves the service management when a customer has more than one service.

To define a new Bundle plan, go to Tariff Plans → Bundles

And click on Add bundle.
