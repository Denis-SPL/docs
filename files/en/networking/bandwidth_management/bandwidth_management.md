Bandwidth management
==========

Splynx has a powerful bandwidth management engine. The software can set speed limitations for customers on different vendors using Radius protocol or you can achieve advanced bandwidth management with the HTB Queuing system of your Mikrotik Router OS. We manage Queues on Mikrotik routers using API. Please feel free to read the following articles related to bandwidth management:
