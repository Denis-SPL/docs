**Tasks**

Every project has various tasks that we create and assign for responsible person. The tasks can be created by clicking the **Add** button in `Scheduling > Tasks`.

The existing tasks can be filtered by a specific project, priority or assignee.

It is also possible to create the task directly form the ticket you are working with by clicking the button **Create task** in the top right corner.
