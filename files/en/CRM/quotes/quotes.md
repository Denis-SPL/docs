Quotes
=======
A quote is a document provided to a lead to inform them of the cost of a service/s before they decide to purchase it.

To view a list of all quotes, simply click on the Quotes menu in the sidebar. Here we can see the Operations panel where we have multiple actions to choose from - *view*, *view PDF*, *download PDF*, *send*, *edit* or *delete*.

Quotes per lead can be accessed by navigating to the Quotes tab on the leads page. Here we can see a list of all quotes generated, a summary of the total value of the quotes and a filter section where we can filter out the quotes we are looking for.

Here we can edit the following fields:

From here we can select the ![Quote Tariff Select](quote_tariff_select.jpg) icon to choose a service to add to the quote. We can also add multiple services by selecting the "+" icon. Services can also be re-ordered by dragging and dropping the services to the selected position.
